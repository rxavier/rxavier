### Hi! I'm Rafael Xavier

#### Summary
I am a data scientist holding a Masters degree in Economics. I have 7+ years of experience working with statistical and machine learning models, involving projects in public policy research as well as in consulting.

In my current role I am tasked with building and leading a data science team at one of Uruguay's largest consulting firms. This includes hiring, reviewing business opportunities, and managing and working on multiple projects, ranging from business intelligence to machine learning deployment.

### Current projects

I enjoy building tooling for data scientists. My team built [Embedding Encoder](https://github.com/cpa-analytics/embedding-encoder), a scikit-learn compatible transformer that leverages neural network embedding layers to process categorical variables, and I'm currently working on [Poniard](https://github.com/rxavier/poniard), a scikit-learn companion library that streamlines model evaluation.

### Past projects

I built [econuy](https://github.com/rxavier/econuy), a data retrieval and processing library for Uruguayan economic statistics. I also built a Flask/Plotly Dash frontend hosted at [econ.uy](https://www.econ.uy/) that's been online since mid-2020.
